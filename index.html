<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_dam">Checkdam</a> ~ a simple struture, strongly connected with the earth, that dissipates destructive forces, captures resourses and buffers against floods and drought downstream.</p>
<p>We want to connect land stewards dealing with erosion, flood or drought issues with local groups that want to participate in water cycle restoration. Please fill in the <a href="https://checkdam.org/checkdam-form/">form</a> to register an interest.</p>
<p>We are working on a syllabus and guides for facilitators, land stewards and governing agencies to support this work.</p>
