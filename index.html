subtitle: Restoring landscapes and people

[Checkdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_dam) ~ a simple struture,
strongly connected with the earth, that dissipates destructive forces, captures
resourses and buffers against floods and drought downstream. We want to connect
land stewards with erosion, flood or drought issues with local groups that want
to participate in water cycle restoration. Please fill in the form if you want
to be involved either way. We are working on a syllabus and facilitator guide to
support this work.
