<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_dam">Checkdam</a> ~ a simple struture, strongly connected with the earth, that dissipates destructive forces, captures resourses and buffers against floods and drought downstream.</p>
<p>We want to connect land stewards dealing with erosion, flood or drought issues with local groups that want to participate in water cycle restoration. Please fill in the <a href="https://checkdam.org/checkdam-form/">form</a> if you want to be involved.</p>
<p>We are working on a syllabus and facilitator guide to support this work.</p>
<p>In the UK planning laws, applications and restrictions delay flood mitigation work. This can be counteracted by setting up Temporary Test Dams in watercourses that can then be monitored and valued. This does however require the landowners support. TTDs have proven to be a great way to get rapid action following a flood event and a way to get communities involved in the defence against future flood events.</p>
