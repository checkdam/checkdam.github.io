WORK IN PROGRESS

At Checkdam.org we beleive that land and water restoration offers a golden opporunity for investors.

The business model is simple: buy degraded, semi arid land, soak in the winter rains and plant food forests and syntropic agriculture.
Create access roads, features to capture the runoff and tent sites where guests irrigate the young trees with their daily activites.
Restoration tourism provides the work force to heal the land while they learn skills needed for the new water paradymn.
A modest amount of permenent housing is eventually rented out to farmers as the tents and tourists move to the next site.
The land is owned in trust and protected forever.

Or you can invest in the projects with a 10 year bond. In line with inflation.

Regenerative agriculture is becoming a mainstream idea. todo - profitable example

Countries like Bhutan have demonstrated the value of protecting their natural resources for carefully managed tourism. todo numbers


With the combination of new technologies like water cycle restoration, restoration of natural forests (not tree farms) and syntropic agriculture degraded land can be transformed in a decade.

One day we might recognise that the ecosystem is the economy.
