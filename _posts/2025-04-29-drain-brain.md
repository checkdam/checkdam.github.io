In the past it made more sense to remove water from the landscape as quickly as possible.

Poor sanitation caused disease and insect issues and water was the carrier.

There were plentiful wetlands and a stable climate so drains some land to grow crops in the rich soil wasn't too harmful, at first.

However, in recent times we are learning that these actions affect the climate and cause so called natural disasters.

Reducing vegitation (clear cutting and ploughing) reduces rainfall locally.

It also reduces water inflitration. This could be due to the fact that hot bare soil repels dropleta like a frying pan.
It could also be that plants pump sugars into the ground. Sugar being hydrophyllic (note the crust on a sugar bowl left out) could be drawing the water in.

Once rain stops infiltrating it starts to runoff, gaining speed and destructive power. The local solution is infrastuture to get rid of the flood waters.
This approach moves the problem downstream, and as many cities are located on flood plains, affects the most people in serious ways.

Once the water is sent to the sea as quickly as possible the next issue arises. Periods without rains lead to droughts. If only we kept that water around!

Even the terms used display this attitude. Watershed vs water catchment.

But don't lose hope. Humanity is just as capable of being a positive force as a negative one.
The steps to reverse climate change are simple enough for children to implement and nature is on the team and will take over management once extablished.

- Reforest the uplands and hillsides (but not monoculture tree farms)
- Heal the wounds - gulleys, tile and other drainage features lower ground water reducing vegitation. Checkdams and beavers ftw.
- restore the coastal wetlands that buffer storm surges

We need to change our relationship with water.
As Sepp Holzer said, the disease is not in the trees, it is in your head.
Death to Drain Brain!
