To stop polluting our air with noxious gases is of course a worth endevour, just listen to your nose next time you walk near a road.

However, for climate stability, greenhouse gas based solutions could take centuries for the climate to be restored to what humans enjoyed 10,000 years ago.  [MIT](https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/how-long-will-it-take-temperatures-stop-rising-or-return-normal-if-we-stop-emitting)

And there is the snowball effect - how much carbon dioxide was released during one of the many recent large fire events?

So, without any judgement, perhaps there is space to consider alternative evidence based solutions.

In India, water cycle restoration has already resulted in 2 degrees celcius drop in regional average temperatures, and a shift from 2% to 48% green cover, amoung many other [benefits](https://tarunbharatsangh.in/impact/#Report)

Science and pdfs are all good but you can experienced directly the effects of water.
- Compare burning your feet on hot sand at the beach vs walking barefoot in the woods or in a meadow.
- Try starting a fire with wet wood.
- Sit in the hot sun for an hour and then in the shade of a tree.

Water has so many other benifits apart from climate stability. Peace - no scarcity - healthy abundent habitat - food and water for all living creatures

I was recently sitting on Glastonbury Tor admiring the green in all directions and was graced a vision of an entirely green earth.
I think it can be realized in my lifetime if we all get the ball rolling soon.

This needs to be a grassroots movement - don't wait for your government to take action as there may sadly be lobbyists for groups with a vested interest in letting the world burn, insane as that statement is.
The only limitation is your imagination. See the work of Burt Lancaster. SLowing and soaking water is a policial act. Be an activist!

You might divert a gutter into a rain garden. This will increase life in your area and reduce flooding and sewage overflows downstream.
Join the waterstories community and "find the others" in your area.
If you really can't find any action in your neighbourhood you can join us on a [Restoration Holiday](https://checkdam.org/2025-02-26-fiona-restoration-holidays/) and even own a part of the endevour.

Together we can save ourselves from flood, fire and drought, which are man made disasters, and see impressive effects in as little as one year. We can make heaven on earth in a lifetime.
