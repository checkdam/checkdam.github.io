WORK IN PROGRESS

24th May 2025, 8am, 35 intrepid water cycle restorers gather at Quintas das Abelhas, [Mark's beautiful farm](https://growback.eu) in Central Portugal.

After intro's, the first order of business, unsurprisingly, was water. A tour of the Spring house and instructions on how to collect water without making a mess.
I appreciate that the Spring hasn't been plumbed to a tap at the house. Fetching the water shows it respect and feels authentic to me.

Throughout the 8 days we received a huge amount of info and experience.
I also feel some sort of transmission happened, perhaps something in the water, but my connection and appreciation for nature is on another level since the course.
The waterstories team are definetly inspired and Mark's love for trees shines through. The sentiment is summed up well in [Zac's message](https://checkdam.org/2025-04-20-zacs-message/)

Large interventions can seem quite radicle (a war zone)
