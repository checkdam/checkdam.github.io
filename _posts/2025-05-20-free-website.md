A friend of mine had her wordpress website disappear thanks to the paid webhost, with no backup :(  alot of work was lost

This is my choosen way to setup a website - mainly because it is free and the world would fall apart if github went away.

It may take a little effort to learn the basics of git but means every version you save is available forever. Great if you delete something by mistake.

### Get a domain (optional)

Buy your choosen domain (with [Ionos](https://www.ionos.co.uk/) if you haven't already) - they have good admin pages and dns updates quickly

Optional: setup a google account for your new domain to keep things seperate.

### Github

Make an account at github with your domain:  [my example](https://github.com/checkdam)

Go to [beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) it is maintained, simple and give you a blog with SEO, social etc very for little work.

Follow the [easy guide](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll?tab=readme-ov-file#the-easy-way-recommended)

Here is my [website's repo](https://github.com/checkdam/checkdam.github.io)

Read through the _config.yml file. You can change colors, logos, social links, add comments etc here. .yml files are tricky but if you break it github has the previous version.

You can make changes on the github website - but I can't advise on that - I prefer to have a local copy for editor highlighting and offline working.

todo: editor, ssh keys, git add, commit, push. email me if you want it part of the guide :)

When you make a change github will build and publish the new version. Reload the page after a minute and your changes should show. todo troubleshooting.

### Mardown

Is a simple way to make things pretty. [cheat sheet](https://markdownguide.offshoot.io/basic-syntax/)

### Link your domain

[guide](https://melissahie.com/blog/github-pages-custom-domain-ionos)

you can also make an email for your domain with Ionos and forward mail to your google account.

There you go! Share this site to your networks please. Spread the good water word. peace.
