**Speaking engagement**

We are happy to present on Water Cycle Restoration and our work in person or online if you can guarantee an audience of at least 50.

---------------

**Waterworks** is our practical water cycle restoration service.

Experienced practitioners trained in the lineage of the mighty Sepp Holzer.

 - consultancy: design and implementation to help reduce local flood then drought issues
 - urban community water projects: slow and sink water, create healthy green spaces and reduce flooding and sewage overflows downstream.
 - farm water projects: increase resiliency and save money in the face of climate change
 - nature: increase biodiversity in biologically sensitive ways

 What to expect:

 We carry a full service, working with you to implement our recommendations rather than just leave you with an expensive pdf.
 We only create designs for sites that we have visited, using an extensive surveying process with multiple modalities.
 Even a good plan never survives contact with reality. During implementation we will communicate and agree every step as the process iterates.

 Next steps:
 Please provide a brief project outline and we will be in touch.
 If your project fits our context we will ask you to complete an extensive form, followed by a free 1 hour good-fit call.
