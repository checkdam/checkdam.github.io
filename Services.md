Retaining water in landscapes has many benefits: more green, carbon capture, less flooding below, groundwater recharge, wells and spring return, ultimately the cool climate is restored. The list goes on.

Earth integrated (unlined) water bodies with clay keyed dams, infiltration terraces and erosion check dams achieve these benefits using natural resources on site. The features can last for hundreds to thousands of years with a small amount of maintenance if built well. Having trained with the Water Stories team, I have the skills, experience and support to create resilient and beautiful water retention features.

## Offerings
 - Water retention projects: increase resiliency and save money in the face of climate change
 - consultancy: design and implementation to help reduce local flood then drought issues
 - urban community water projects: slow and sink water, create healthy green spaces and reduce flooding and sewage overflows downstream.
 - nature: increase biodiversity in biologically sensitive ways

## The team

### Peter Wilkins - Water Restoration Practitioner

After careers in Outdoor Education and finacial Software Engineering, Peter found water cycle restoration and discovered it was the key to healing long term mental health issues.
With a strong desire to share this discovery and help steer humanity back to it's true purpose of land stewardship in sympathy with nature, he started checkdam.org.

 What to expect:

 We carry a full service, working with you to implement our recommendations rather than just leave you with an expensive pdf.
 We only create designs for sites that we have visited, using an extensive surveying process with multiple modalities.
 Even a good plan never survives contact with reality. During implementation, we will communicate and agree every step as the process iterates.

 Next steps:
 Please provide a brief project outline, and we will be in touch.
 If your project fits our context we will ask you to complete an extensive form, followed by a free 1-hour good-fit call.
