### Family holiday problems
It is hard to please the whole family at once but that is what we will aim for. 
As a co-op, descisions will be made democratically by the membership.


### Tourism feels empty
Travelling with a greater purpose vs. bus tours to look at old buildings (sorry if you like old buildings)


### The recipe
Centre Parcs (no cars) meets Eurocamp (glamping) meets Diggerland meets Green gym meets nature therapy
Water, tents, activities, little frenchy beers, yoga, kids clubs, no cars, just bikes, quiet and party zones
Good works: experience, education, restoration, nature, bonding and making friends, self-esteem,

### Avoid the peak prices
Water restoration season (i.e. when it isn't raining) coincides with the Summer Holidays in the UK.


### Travelling with the family is fun but stressful
Airport transfers from select flights, local culture and cusine (but also fish fingers), 
Own the bus - day trips, 


### Investing aligned with your values
If you are reading this then your values probably align with ours.  
Have your money work for you and your children's future climate

### Skin in the game
Everyone involved will have invested interest (a membership co-op), decisions will be voted by all members online

### Finding a site
semi arid region
dried up springs and wells,
erosion gulleys, 
sick trees, 
good geology and land shape for central lake
owning entire water catchment to protect water from upstream disturbance

### Design
experienced professional water retention experts build main lake, temporary ponds and access roads, designed to work with nature
ensuring that after winter rains there is enough water captured for guest season.
water is constantly recycled through the ground, pumped back up to top of site and reused for benifit of people and trees

no kids zones, quiet zones, party zones, 

### Pioneers trees fed by human grey water
Non-flooding Tent sites (ever camped in Wales?), 
shower and sinks drain to shade trees
Solar, no smell toilets, collected daily, composted remotely
Trees grown sucessionally - transtion to food forests around each tent site
