*Heal the land, heal yourself*


Checkdam.org has a mission to bring the experience, empowerment and ownership of Water Cycle Restoration to the public, especially young people and those struggling to live life to the fullest.

Possible activities:
- Visiting schools to provide support  to students designing, building and monitoring water retention features on the grounds.
- Eco-tourism where schools and family can relax or get involved in the water restoration going on around them. Centre parcs meets Diggerland meets VSO.
- Investment opportunities and sense of ownership and involvement in places coming back to life.
- Retreats where people can reconnect with nature and themselves through learning and working with water.

First milestone: 1 million acres of degraded land restored to full health, 1 million students participated and benifited from the work.


*Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him ~~for a lifetime~~ till the fish run out. Teach him to build ponds and it's fish tacos for everyone, forever.*
